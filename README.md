# Integration testing of API Controllers with NUnit and XUnit
## This is a test project for Back-End Test Automation March 2024 Course @ SoftUni.
This repository showcases integration testing of API controllers in an ASP.NET MVC project using NUnit and xUnit frameworks.
### Project Goal:

This project demonstrates how to write integration tests to verify the functionality of API controllers in isolation from the entire application stack (e.g., database, UI).

### Testing Frameworks:

- NUnit: A mature and popular .NET testing framework.
- xUnit: A free and open-source testing framework known for its readability and ease of use.
### Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of ASP.NET MVC, C#, and web APIs.
- Familiarity with NUnit or xUnit (choose one or both).
- Familiarity with SSMS(SQL Server Management Studio).

### Understanding the Application (Brief Summary):

- The application under test is an ASP.NET MVC project named "Eventmi".
- It manages events and was focused on writing API tests for this functionality, it is also interacting with a database managed through SSMS.
### Additional Notes:

The specific setup and configuration steps might vary depending on the project's implementation.
This repository serves as a starting point for learning integration testing of API controllers.
